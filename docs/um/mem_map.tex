\section{Memory Map}
\label{sec:mem_map}

In this section the memory map of the system, where the controller is
integrated, is presented as seen by its Control Bus interface.

The Control Bus interface, allows the programmers to access different parts
of the system by using the addresses given in this section.

The base addresses given in Table~\ref{tab:memmap} are reserved. Other
addresses may be added to the memory map as they are needed to access
new peripherals.
